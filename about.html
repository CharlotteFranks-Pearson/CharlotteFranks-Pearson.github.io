  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> One of the reasons I chose teaching is because I have a passion for creating textiles works as well as cooking and I wanted to be able to channel that love into a career and inspire others to love these areas. I have included a few images of my textiles works below, these I works that I have created as part of uni but also textiles works </p>
