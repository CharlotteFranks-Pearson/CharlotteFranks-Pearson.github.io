        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I chose to pursue teaching because of my passion for creativity, particularly in textiles and food. I wanted to channel this love into a career where I can inspire students to explore and appreciate these areas. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong interest in the creative arts and the textiles industry, and I enjoy bringing that enthusiasm into my teaching practice. My goal as a Design and Technology teacher is not only to share practical skills, but also to encourage students to think critically, experiment with ideas, and find pride in their own creations.</p>

        <p>My personal teaching style is centred around creating an inclusive, supportive, and engaging learning environment where students feel confident to take risks and express their individuality. I value hands-on, project-based learning that allows students to see the real-world application of what they are creating. I also believe in fostering resilience and problem-solving skills by encouraging students to embrace challenges and view mistakes as opportunities for growth.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I am becoming a Design and Technology teacher because I believe creativity is an essential life skill that helps students build confidence, adaptability, and joy in learning. I want to inspire young people to not only develop technical skills in textiles and food but also to see the broader possibilities of design in shaping their future pathways.</p>

          <p>In my personal life, I love being outdoors and bushwalking and rock climbing. Bushwalking allows me to gain inspiration from nature for a lot of my projects, whether this be incorporating the colour palette of the landscapes I see or incorporating other aspects of nature into my projects.</p>
          <p>I also have two cats, and my family is currently raising a Guide Dog Puppy (with Guide Dogs Australia) called Yolanda. We are responsible for caring for and training her (teaching things like house manners and commands) for 14 months before handing her back to complete her assessment to determine whether she will be a guide dog or follow a different path (therapy dog, breeding dog, ambassador dog).</p>
