        <h3>Personal Project - Beaded Fish Bag</h3>
        <p>
          This image is a beaded bag that I created in my spare time and drew inspiration from an existing bag design. 
          The front of the bag features detailed work such as an entirely embroidered background and beads and sequins on the front. 
          The bag features fringe beading as well as other beading techniques, all of which were self-taught. 
          This bag took 70 hours over 6 months and is a great example of what is achievable with textiles with very little prior experience.

        <h3>University Assessment - Art Quilt</h3>
        <p>
          This Art Quilt was created as part of a University assessment completed in my second year, where we were required to create two quilts: an art quilt and a community quilt, and dye our own fabrics for both. 
          This quilt featured three pieces: the middle piece was hand-quilted, and the base piece featured six different embroidery techniques and two beaded and sequin appliqu√© pieces, both made by me. 
          The embroidery techniques used were overtwist stitch, satin stitch, chain stitch, French knot, button stitch, and running stitch.

        <h3>Carrot Cake</h3>
        <p>
          This is an example of some of the cooking I have done at home, creating visually appealing and flavoursome cakes with multiple components. 
          I used this as an example for Food Technology in the Foods for Specific Events aspect of the syllabus.
