          <h3>Personal Project - Beaded Fish Bag </h3>
          <p>This image is a beaded bag that I created in my spare time and drew inspiration from an existing bag deisgn. The front of the bag featrues detailed work suh as an entirely emboridered background and then adding beads and sequins the front. The bag features fringe beaading as well as other beading techniques all of which were self taught. This bag took 70 hours over 6 months and is a great example of what is achaiveable with textiles withvery little prior expeience.   </p>

The embroidery techniquess used were; overtwist stitch, satin stitch, chain stitch, french knot, boolean stitch and running stich. </p>
